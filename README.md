# SPOTIFY_DB
## overview 
#This project is about analyzing a Spotify dataset using MySQL. I wrote different queries to answer questions about the data, such as finding popular tracks, checking artist performance, and exploring genre trends. The aim is to practice SQL skills and show how databases can be used to get useful insights from real-world music data.
